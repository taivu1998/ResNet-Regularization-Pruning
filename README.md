# ResNet-Regularization-Pruning

This program provides a Pytorch Lightning implementation of the ResNet architecture with mixup and cutout regularizations and soft filter pruning. The goal is to reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) while improving predictive accuracy. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13593)

## Algorithms

### Mixup Regularization

Mixup adds convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels to the training data, which improves the generalization error of cutting-edge network architectures, alleviates the memorization of corrupt labels, and increases sensitivity to adversarial examples (Zhang et al., 2017).

### Cutout Regulaization

Cutput randomly masks out contiguous square regions of the input images to CNNs, which improves robustness and yields higher accuracy level (DeVries & Taylor, 2017).

### Soft Filter Pruning

Soft filter pruning simultaneously trains the model and prunes convolutional filters below some threshold in every epoch, which generates a compact model at the end (He et al., 2018).

## Installation

The project requires the following frameworks:

- PyTorch: https://pytorch.org

- PyTorch Lightning: https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning

- W&B: https://www.wandb.com

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

There are several optional command line arguments:

- --arch: ResNet architecture, such as 'resnet20' or 'resnet18'.
- --dataset: Dataset, such as 'cifar10' or 'cifar100'.
- --regularize: Regularization techniques, such as 'mixup' or 'cutout'.
- --prune: Pruning techniques, such as 'soft_filter'.
- --batch-size: Size of a training batch.
- --lr: Learning rate.
- --epochs: Number of training epochs.
- --alpha-mixup: Mixup interpolation coefficient.
- --n-holes-cutout: Number of holes to cut out from image.
- --length-cutout: Length of the holes in cutout.
- --pruning-rate: Compress rate of a model.

To calculate the number of FLOPs, use the following command:

```bash
python flopsCount.py
```
